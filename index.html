            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I’m a passionate Junior Web Developer with a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies.
                Self-motivated and detail-oriented, I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites and web
                applications. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Node.js. I thrive
                in collaborative environments, continuously learning and improving my craft. With a focus on clean code
                and intuitive design, I aim to deliver projects that not only meet but exceed client expectations. When
                I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends and working on personal projects to expand my skill
                set. Let’s build something great together!</p>
